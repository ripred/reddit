I had a battery pack for 3 18650 1500mAh batteries and so I connected the black wire to 12 volts and then the red wire was attached to a rocker switch with the orange wire that went to ground. This was all on the L298N driver module. I then had various wires connected to the arduino. What was the problem? Is that too much power (which I thought it wasn't, since I saw people with more powerful batteries powering their cars)? Or did I mess up a connection? Thanks!",
