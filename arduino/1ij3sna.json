I have a mechanical setup that moves a lever up and down in the enclosed box. I want to know the distance as it moves up and down so I can program adjustments. \n\nI thought a waterproof ultrasonic would be perfect for this, but they usually are in the 2cm minimum range, but the lever moves up and down almost the entire box. I could change the design (limit the movement) but not sure if I need to? I tried hall sensors but they were too short range, I would need about 3 placed outside the box and a magnet connected to the lever to sense properly.\n\nIdeas?",
