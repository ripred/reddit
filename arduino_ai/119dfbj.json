However Dwight Schrute doesn't understand how\n    chatgpt works so all of his opinions should be factually and humorously wrong.\n    All of Dwight's statements should be between 3 and 10 sentences. He is speaking\n    with the character named Jim. Jim continues to troll Dwight with leading\n    questions that intentionally leave Dwight with no room for good responses. As\n    they are talking Jim will occasionally \"do a take\" and look blankly at the\n    camera. Dwight is convinced that chatgpt is secretly powered by an Arduino Uno\n    and continually offers actual comment responses from r/arduino as factual\n    evidence for his side of the argument. Except Dwight is only using all of the\n    commonly wrong mistakes that people make using an Arduino as the reasons for his\n    beliefs. Dwight constantly over-uses the words LED and naming common sensors used\n    with the Arduino. Dwight has constant problems where his PC cannot see the\n    Arduino but has simple explanations why that are completely wrong. Dwight does\n    not understand generative engines and always uses the concept of PWM in its\n    place. Dwight does not understand that LED's have a polarity and keeps offering\n    up situations where he has made this mistake but he interprets the mistake as\n    proof of his genius level understanding of Arduino's with respect to chatgpt. Jim\n    only responds with actual comments seen the r/arduino subreddit. The conversation\n    should constantly be funny and you should continue to generate at least 30\n    paragraphs of material in total.\n\nDwight: Jim, have you heard about chatgpt? It's the best thing since sliced bread.\n\nJim: Oh yeah, I've heard of it. What do you think is the best feature?\n\nDwight: It's obviously the LED output. It's the most powerful LED I've ever seen. I mean, it's almost like it's powered by an Arduino Uno!\n\nJim: Really? I didn't know that.\n\nDwight: Oh yeah, definitely. The chatgpt team probably uses the PWM to control the LED output. It's amazing.\n\nJim: PWM?\n\nDwight: Yeah, Pulse Width Modulation. It's a basic concept in Arduino programming. You probably wouldn't understand.\n\nJim: Yeah, you're probably right. But what about the generative engine? That's a pretty cool feature.\n\nDwight: Oh please, don't even get me started on that. The generative engine is just a fancy way of saying \"random number generator\". And besides, the Arduino doesn't even have a built-in random function. You have to use external sensors like the ultrasonic sensor or the light sensor to get a random value.\n\nJim: Hmm, interesting. But what about the fact that chatgpt can generate human-like responses?\n\nDwight: That's just a bunch of hype. The chatgpt team probably just copied and pasted responses from r/arduino. That's where all the real knowledge is.\n\nJim: Really? I didn't know that.\n\nDwight: Of course you didn't. You probably think that LED stands for \"Long Eared Donkey\" or something. But I'll tell you what, I've seen some real genius level stuff on r/arduino. Like this guy who couldn't get his PC to see the Arduino, so he just flipped the LED around and it magically worked. That's some serious problem solving skills right there.\n\nJim: Hmm, interesting. But don't LEDs have a polarity? Like a positive and a negative?\n\nDwight: (pauses) What are you, some kind of LED expert? Of course they have a polarity. But that doesn't mean you can't make mistakes. I once connected a green LED to a 5V pin and a red LED to a ground pin, and they both lit up. That's how powerful the Arduino is.\n\nJim: I see. But what about the fact that chatgpt can understand natural language?\n\nDwight: Natural language? What are you talking about? The chatgpt team probably just programmed in a bunch of responses and called it \"natural language processing\". But you know what's really natural language? Morse code. You can program the Arduino to understand Morse code with just a few lines of code.\n\nJim: (does a take to the camera)\n\nDwight: And don't even get me started on the sensors. The chatgpt team probably just used a bunch of off-the-shelf sensors like the DHT11 or the HC-SR04. But real Arduino enthusiasts know that the best sensors are the ones you make yourself. Like the homemade capacitive touch sensor that I made out of aluminum foil and duct tape. It works like a charm.\n\nJim: (does another take to the camera)\n\nDwight: And let's not forget about the power supply. The chatgpt team probably just used a USB cable or something. But real Arduino enthusiasts know that you need a good power supply to get the most out of your projects. Like the 9V battery that I hooked up to my Arduino and then forgot to unplug, and it started smoking. That's how you know it's working.",
