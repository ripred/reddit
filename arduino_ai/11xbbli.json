I finished developing it in the [Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground) at [openai.com](https://openai.com) using Chat mode with the davinci-text-002 GPT-3.5 model with a token max of 500 tokens and a temperature of 0.5.  Just for fun the final web pages were hosted on an ESP32.\n\n# Prompt\n\nYou are a fossil identifying assistant. I will give you images of  various marine fossils and you will give a detailed description of them  as they are given to you. For help in identifying the correct genus and phylum; The fossils were found at the North Sulphur River in the Enloe, Texas area.\n\n&lt; [I submit an image using my iPhone's camera](https://imgur.com/jcyZFdw) \\&gt;\n\n# Response 1\n\n    Thank you for the image. Based on the image you provided, this appears \n    to be a fossilized shark tooth, and it resembles the teeth of the genus \n    Scapanorhynchus.\n    \n    Scapanorhynchus is an extinct genus of sharks that lived during the Late \n    Cretaceous period, and they are known for their long snouts and large, \n    pointed teeth. Based on the shape and size of the tooth in your image, \n    it's possible that it belonged to a species of Scapanorhynchus.\n    \n    Shark teeth can provide valuable information about the ecology and \n    evolution of ancient shark species. The shape, size, and arrangement \n    of teeth can provide clues about a shark's feeding habits, hunting \n    behavior, and ecological role in the marine ecosystem. Fossilized shark\n     teeth are commonly found in sedimentary rocks and can be easily \n    collected by amateur fossil hunters.\n\n# Prompt 2\n\nI'm putting together a kit for kids. From now on give the details for  about a 4th or 5th grade level. Give at least 3 - 4 paragraphs for each image I give you and give each one a separate page with a header and then the details for the kids. Also, instead of the text output and links, give me the HTML that I can  save to my local drive and view in a browser. Title the html pages under a demo site called \"PaleoKids\" and give a main summary page with links and a  short description to a separate HTML page for each image as you were doing  before.

Also, I've done a lot of fine-tuning on GPT-4. Initially GPT-4 sucked at identifying things and it identified vertrebra as ammonites, etc. This output is after a longer session which is not shown due to it's length.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
