This HMI system should display temperature, pressure, and O2/CO2 concentrations in water. The above sensors and motors are connected to a control system via the Arduino Mega. It should also be able to display an animation of the tank levels rising and falling as well as the piping systems filling up with gas and water. The issue is as follows: Our current touchscreen is the Nextion Basic 7'' HMI LCD Touch Display which is only able to support images not animations. For our project, we are looking for a touchscreen wherein we can create the animation ourselves and run it, while also being compatible with the Arduino Mega. I would appreciate some guidance on how to resolve this issue. Ultimately, we are looking for a touchscreen that supports creating animations/running animations and is also compatible with Arduino (if not compatible, then attachable to a module that is compatible with Arduino). Unfortunately, my team and I are under a deadline of one month so we cannot purchase screens outside of Canada. \n\nThank you so much for your help, I appreciate any advice on our issue. \n\nHamna ",
