  "selftext": "[PID Library](https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PIDLibrary/)\n\nPID (ni PID Loops) is an algorithm for setting an output target to a value based on feedback. The algorithm excels at smoothly bring an output to a particular value while receiving feedback from the system to help guide it.\n\nA good example of a PID loop in action is the cruise control in cars. The car is set to stay at a consistent target speed. When the car is faster or slower than that speed it does not simply let off of the gas completely or set it to it max instead it adds the appropriate amount of gas based off of the target speed and the current speed and acceleration rate of the car. If the difference is large and getting larger then a larger proportional amount of gas is added.  If the difference is small and getting smaller than the target speed then a smaller proportional amount of gas is added.\n\n[This library by Brett Beauregard](https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/) implements an excellently designed PID library with the ability to set important aspects of the algorithm if you need to.  By default the algorithm self-calibrates to the update rate you call it and update it's feedback but this can be changed if necessary. That is just an example and many other configurable options exist.",
