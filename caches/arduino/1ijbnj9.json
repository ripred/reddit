Everything works as I want it to.\n\nNow, I want to transfer this to a PCB that will be soldered at the factory, where all components will just be plugged in. I started designing in EasyEDA, added all the connectors and female headers for my ESP32, but I\u2019m struggling with how to integrate something similar to the breadboard power supply to connect my 12V power supply to the PCB.\n\nAfter researching, I found that the LM2596 could be used for this, but I\u2019m struggling to integrate it into my PCB. EasyEDA has too many options, and I mostly see just the chip itself rather than a complete module like the ones sold online.\n\nHow can I properly add a 12V to 5V buck converter to my PCB in EasyEDA? Should I use the LM2596 or another alternative? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",
