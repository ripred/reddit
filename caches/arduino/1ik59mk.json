He had a few basic \"would like to have\" and a few \"would love to have in a perfect world\" requests and I was able to pass each hurdle and learn along the way to tick off everything off his list.   I wanted to really show off how powerful a little Arduino can be for future projects.  I ended up going with an Arduino Mega 2560 for the extra pins, I quickly ran out on the normal board.\n\nFeatures:  \nA photoresistor detects if the room is dark.  \nIf it is, turn on 6 streetlights, and then randomly turn on 8 house lights within a 1-5 second window.  \nTurn on the headlights and taillights on two cars randomly within a 1-5 second window.  \nHave a 4-leg RGB LED flicker for a campfire effect.  \nIf a toggle is switched on and it's night, flicker some Christmas lights.  \nMake a car's turn indicator randomly blink every few minutes.  \nWhen a piezo sensor detects the vibration of an incoming train, have two lights alternate on/off and play a \"ding ding\" sound for the railroad crossing\".  \nWhen a button is pressed, ambient train sounds play for about an hour.\n\nI also added redundant switches to everything so that it can be also triggered manually.\n\nSecret Feature!  \nI added a secret function that I won't tell him about.  If the sound button is pressed twice quickly, all the lights start flashing and the Thomas the Train theme song plays.  I managed to save the state of the lights so that they return to what they were after the song ends.\n\nHardest parts was definitely incorporating sound.  I used two DFPlayer Minis and had a really tough time getting one to work.  If the wiring was wrong or there was an issue with the script, or if there was insufficient power the board would just lock up and wait for nothing to happen.  Big sigh of relief when I finally got it working.  Now I'll forever remember that the TX pin on the DFPlayer goes to the RX pin on the Arduino and not the TX pin.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1ik59mk/video/6soq6bza4she1/player\n\n",
