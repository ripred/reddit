I am planning on using a Nano for the controller, an RTC to keep time, a relay to turn on the pump, and 2 potentiometers, 1 to adjust how often the pump turns on and the other to adjust how long the pump is on for. \n\nSo far, I have gotten everything to work individually, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to put it all together. I have the relay working and powering the pump, and I can read the pot value and have ranges set up to adjust the duration that the pump is on for.\n\nThe furthest I have gotten with the RTC is reading the current time. The 2 things I need help with are; how do I trigger the relay at a specific time everyday, and how can I adjust what time the relay is triggered. For example, if the pot is in the middle range turn the pump on every day at 8:00AM, if its in the low range turn the pump on at 8:00AM and 8:00PM everyday, and if its in the high range turn the pump on at 8:00AM every 2 days. Or maybe there is an easier way? I'm open to suggestions. \n\nThanks,",
