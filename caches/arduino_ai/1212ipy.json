A lot of the approaches work mainly with the construction of the board itself and representing the pieces on the board using LEDs etc. But very few projects have attempted to create the chess engine itself using a microprocessor.\n\nThis is the first post of a series that will develop a complete chess engine for the Arduino platform. I will make every attempt to see if it can be done using an Uno or Nano but we'll see. This isn't my first chess engine so hopefully the project can benefit from some of the things I've tried in the past. edit: With a small amount of abstraction the engine could be for checkers or any other turn-based game that uses pieces and a fixed-size board as well.\n\nI really hope there is interest in learning about building out the software side of an engine and how it can be approached. This engine will use [the Minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) with [alpha/beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) and will support ply depth searching and constraints, time limits, [quiescent ply searches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiescence_search), [en-passant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant) captures, and many many other features.\n\nWith each post I intend to create the next layer of support for the engine along with new concepts and I  hope there are a lot comments and questions about the code and what it does and why it does it and why it does it a certain way.\n\n[The first release is here](https://github.com/ripred/MicroChess).\n\nThis whole project will be an exercise in data structures and algorithms. So if that stuff gave you nightmares in college hopefully the discussions in these posts and comments will help lol. A lot of work has gone into trying to get the memory usage and footprints down to an absolute minimum.\n\nThe three most costly data structures will be:\n\n* to contain a piece, its type, side, check state, and moved state\n* to represent a board layout\n* to represent a move from one spot to another along with the value of the move\n\nThe size of these 3 three structures will determine how well the game can play on a Nano or an Uno. I have no doubt that a version of a playable game can be fit but how many moves ahead it can examine is still to be determined.\n\nThe size of those structures is so important that I initially created a version where each piece would occupy 1 byte, so the entire board was represented by a 64 byte array which is not bad.\n\nBut each piece actually takes up 6 bits, not 1 byte. So that meant that there were 128 bits or 16 bytes wasted. So I rewrote the entire board class to only occupy 48 bytes. You can see the two versions in the code and I really hope there are questions or comments. update: Thanks to u/triffid_hunter it's already smaller.\n\nThis first release can simply hold the state of any board and display it to a Serial port.\n\nSo let me know if your want to see more in this series posted here and any comments or questions you might have.\n\n     R  N  B  Q  K  B  N  R \n     P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P \n     .  *  .  *  .  *  .  * \n     *  .  *  .  *  .  *  . \n     .  *  .  *  .  *  .  * \n     *  .  *  .  *  .  *  . \n     p  p  p  p  p  p  p  p \n     r  n  b  q  k  b  n  r \n\nAll the Best!\n\n`ripred`\n\nedit: As u/johannes1234 points out, [https://www.chessprogramming.org/](https://www.chessprogramming.org/) is a fantastic resource for learning about different approaches, board storage tricks, &amp;c. Definitely worth checking out.",
