Fun thing to try out [&lt;a href=\"https://callsam.ai/\"&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For one coffee a month, I&amp;#39;ll send you 2 newsletters a week with all of the most important &amp;amp; interesting stories like these written in a digestible way. You can &lt;a href=\"https://nofil.beehiiv.com/upgrade\"&gt;sub here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: For those wondering why its paid - I hate ads and don&amp;#39;t want to rely on running ads in my newsletter. I&amp;#39;d rather try and get paid to do all this work like this than force my readers to read sponsorship bs in the middle of a newsletter. Call me old fashioned but I just hate ads with a passion&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: If you&amp;#39;d like to tip you can tip here &lt;a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil\"&gt;https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nofil&lt;/a&gt;. Absolutely no pressure to do so, appreciate all the comments and support \ud83d\ude4f&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can read the free newsletter &lt;a href=\"https://nofil.beehiiv.com/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: I had to go through over 100 saved tabs to collate all of these and it took me quite a few hours&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: So many people ask why I don&amp;#39;t get chatgpt to write this for me. Chatgpt doesn&amp;#39;t have access to the internet. Plugins would help but I don&amp;#39;t have access yet so I have to do things the old fashioned way - like a human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#39;m not associated with any tool or company. Written and collated entirely by me, no chatgpt used)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
